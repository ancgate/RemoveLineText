# RemoveLineText
This is a simple Java Program. The Idea was to get links from a csv file that match a pattern and then save it into another csv file

Steps 

1) I used LinkClipper to get alls the links on the page and saves it to a csv files.
2) I run RemoveLineText which does the following 
    a) Remove all blanks spaces and headers and some footers in the files
    b) Filter all the links that matches a pattern
    c) Put all the links that matches a pattern and save them in a new CSV files
3) Get the resource needed behind that link. This steps is not yet implemented. I hope to implement it in the future.
